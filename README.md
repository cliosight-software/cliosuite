# cliosuite
This repo is for the open-sourced code of the cliosuite applications. This project is partly open-source. 
Our aim is to develop boilerplate projects in various technologies for some of the most relevant areas across industries 
where students, developers and startups wish to innovate and develop projects faster. Instead of having to look for interesting 
apllication areas, they can directly surf through our code projects and articles.
The domain related articles that are shared regularly through the cliosight.com blog section. The Cliosuite MSME web application 
currently being developed, will also have exclusive articles for paid members.

Our first open-source project is a simple demonstration of express js, mysql, node js, bootstrap, HTML and CSS technologies 
to create a product introduction web app.
Instead of creating a single application for both the main project and the application introduction, we have decided to 
keep it seperate, and collect survey data and other information from the users exclusively through this simple web application.

The main project source code will be shared later, once we have reached a particular count of interested users.
Please donate to help us complete this significantly large project.
